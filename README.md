# Library

This repository is my library for C. knr.h contains functions copied directly from K&R's ANSI C book. rampion.h has functions and macros I modified from K&R or wrote myself. 

knr.h may conflict with other included libraries because of function names. I did not rename them. rampion.h should not conflict with standard libraries. Neither will conflict with stdio.h.
